Status:
	* Glyph, Lexicon, Dictionary, and Parser classes are up
		* care lexicon is hardcoded for now, but can load from a file
		* glyph can instantiate off of complex names
	* Dictionary is split from Lexicon (so Lexicon is only internal words, all else goes in Dictionary)
	* beginnings of a parser
		* dev copy takes a string, parses it, then turns it back into a string

Current goal:
	* restore functionality to what it was before the refactor

Next:
	* convert Glyph over to use Lexicon and hard typing, and move it to the new interface
	* get rule process class up (even if it may end up temporary)
		* convert existing parser and deparser steps to rules (a temporary format is fine for now)
		* use command symbols as handles for all rule commands (w/ parameters and output)


Changed:
	* got Parser to use the dictionary instead of the lexicon
	* Deparser can properly expand nouns w/ articles and adjectives
	

Changes:
	* add "value" to glyphs (only used when relevant)
	* make a word a value of a grammar glyph, not it's actual name


Refactoring:
	* after current round:
		* move Lexicon to a global (that everything has access to) - eliminate Glyph needing to have it pointed out
			* also remove double-lex unit tests
	* eliminate direct access to glyph hash
		* still a little work to be done
	* status
		* Things are cleaned up through to Dictionary - updating it to changes
	

Issues:


Doing:
	* reshaping lexicon output
		* dictionary needs to get it from glyph
		* glyph creation tries to create from a lex if given one, otherwise the glyph has no parentage
	* glyph changes:
		* glyphs now have a "type()", returning a string name of main parent (or "" for null)
		* names are in use but no longer define what they are (they're the "value")
		* no need to store parentage (lexicon handles that)
	* goal: restore deparsing and get unit tests working again

Todo list:
	* adjective properties
		* assign properties (like height, size, etc) to adjectives in dictionary
		* order adjectives based on properties (and avoid duplicating a type in output)

	* unified logging
		* each major class can be passed a ref to the logger
		* logs are written to file, and optionally printed to screen
	* work on dictionary lookups:
		* looking up the definition for a word
			* entries need to contain more details (singular, etc)
				* entries can contain multiple items if multiple apply (singular and plural, etc)
		* looking up the word for a definition
			* dictionary is made to just let the parser give it a glyph and let it find the word
			* dictionary will fallback slightly if there's no exact definition
	
	
	* lists - support for a glyph acting as a list
		* lex type "data>list"
		* adds list manipulation to glyphs
			* add, remove, insert symbols before or after a target symbol
			* split a glyph, inserting the split before or after
				* split(type) removes that type from the glyph and returns the removed modifier
				* pop(type)
		* greatly 

	* glyph list manipulation:
		* bud - split a modifier from a symbol and insert it (before or after it or another symbol)
		* need a function to target a specific word in the list
		* pointer that keeps track of where the cursor is on the list
			* the cursor roves from one symbol to the next, focusing on one symbol
			
	* further development of grammar processing
		* streamline:
			* add support for symbol manipulation within a symbol
			* convert existing code into rules
			* more overloading, but must be self-consistent
	* develop parser's symbol manipulation into something more general purpose
		* move these functions to the glyph itself (manipulating its payload)
			* this means payloads must now allow duplication
		* this should help obviate the need to manipulate arrays directly



Glyph Typing:
	* goals:
		* strict glyph typing and inheritance
		* no outside manipulation of a glyph's parentage - limited to a few functions (inherit, revert, setParent)
		* outsiders can only access the payload via methods, and direct array manipulation is discouraged
	* it's possible the lexicon may need to go below glyph
		* this allows glyph to handle more of the typing, and make types more strict
			* much less lexicon checking, and removes the need for anything to edit a glyph's parentage
		* lexicon would have to change so it doesn't rely on glyphs at all
			* traits have to be name-based (with the glyph doing the lookups)
			* parents are by name 
		* when creating a glyph from a type, the glyph references the lexicon and builds it to type
			* traits associated with a lextype are merged into the glyph's payload
		* glyphs never write to the lexicon - they only read it
		* all glyphs need access to the same lexicon
			* for now, the entire package is assigned a lexicon to use, and the functions for using it are private-ish
			



New Glyph Functions:
	* overloads:
		* look for a way to impersonate an array if referenced like one - return payload
		* all functions return glyph responses.  These should evaluate as true or false on a boolean check
	* info:
		* 
	* payload:
		* list()      - returns the payload as an array of whatever
		* clear()     - empties the payload.
		* count()     - the number of payload items 
		* add()       - adds one or more items to the payload
		* merge()     - given a list of symbols, will merge symbols in (rather than just adding them)
		* peek()      - returns a copy of the matching payload item.  accepts a type or an index
		* pop()       - returns the matching payload item, removing it from the owner (doubles as a delete).  type or index.
		* has(type)   - returns a copy of payload with a direct match (first one it sees)
		* hasa(type)  - returns a copy of any payload that has a parentage match (first one it sees)
	* parentage:
		* is(type)
		* isa(type)
		* parent()         - returns the immediate parent
		* parents()        - returns an array (or "list"?) of all parents
	* spawning:
		* new(name)        - creates a brand new glyph, a null if no params, or a clone with the same id if given a glyph
		* error(message)   - returns an error glyph w/ embedded message
		* clone()          - creates a deep copy of the glyph.  ID preserved.
		* spawn()          - creates a new glyph with the creator as its parent.  new id.

Agent (in need of a better name)
	* list manipulation: (goes in another Agent class)
		* {cursor}          - the index id the cursor is currently at
		* return()			- returns the cursor to its previous position (only tracks one)
		* next()			- moves the cursor backwards by one
		* previous()		- moves the cursor ahead by one
		* cursor()			- gets or sets the current index
		* cleave(type) 		- removes an item from the targeted word and inserts it as a word before or after
		* merge(next/prev)  - 
		




Editing Walkthrough:
	* given a symbol, marked as a list, with a payload of symbols
	* rules must return if they acted or not - and need a way to tell if they're necessary
	* iterative function that loops from index 0 to end (adjusts for changes to array)
		* peek(index) - repeats until none are true (or too many loops - stuck rule)
			* isa noun?
				* hasa article?    	- cleave(article, -1)		#move it to before
				* hasa adjective   	- cleave(adjective, -1)		#move it to before (but after previous insert)
				* isa proper noun?
					* !capitalized?	- capitalize word
			* isa verb?
				* hasa tense?
					* look for dictionary entry for that verb and that tense
						* need to be able to use "verb:past progressive"




Symbol Stream Manipulation:
	* all streams of symbols are stored within another symbol


Serialization:
	* glyphs may need to do their own serialization (avoid if possible)
		* makes it easier to ignore unnecessary info (like parentage)

Glyph Changes:
	* see if full lineage can be stored non-publicly (since the outside never needs it directly)
		* this keeps it from being serialized
		* a basic "parent" can be restored, which can be checked publicly and is serialized
		* this means that lineage will have to be rebuilt on glyph init (based on lexicon)


Standards:
	* strict layering:
		* each module fits within a clear layer
		* Lexicon never touches Glyph, and Glyph never touches Dictionary, Parser, etc.
		
		* Lexicon never touches Dictionary or Parser, though it relies heavily on Glyph
		* Dictionary never touches Parser, though it relies heavily on Glyph and Lexicon
	* any function that normally returns a glyph must ALWAYS return a glyph
		* NULL glyphs are used when there is no data, though ERROR glyphs may go into use too




Study:
	* predicate logic vs propositional logic.
		* proposition - statement is either true or false
	* modus ponens - "if p then q", and p=true, then assumes q=true
