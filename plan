Current Focus:
	* build out conversion between natural and symbolic language - Parser and Deparser
		* this involves the Lexicon and Glyphs (basis of symbol system) and Dictionary (word definitions)
		* involves some limited symbol manipulation during parsing



Planned Modules:
	Current:
	* Lexicon 		- controls all symbol typing and hierarchy
	* Glyph			- data structure used for nearly everything
	* Dictionary	- index of plaintext words and multiple meanings (not kbase, just word types and associations)
	* Parser		- handles the act of converting between symbols and natural language




Types of Logic to support:
	* lists - allows a list of symbols to be collated, prioritized, sorted, and culled back



Types of Data to support:
	* people -
